# Course Project

1. I am a hobbyist fiction writer. There is an exercise that involves multiple writers working together to create a story by writing one part and having another to write the next part. The problem is that there are few platforms on which to perform this sort of exercise aside from pen and paper in real life, online forums, and websites.

1. My idea is a website where writers will be able to do this exercise with other writers with a competitive twist. There will be a preset beginning of a story that writers will continue to write with a limit on both word count and time. Other users and writers can then vote on a part they think best suit the story and the winning story segment will be continued upon for the next set of writing.

1. The information my website will store are the story segments that the writers made and comments made by the readers. Users must create an account to write or vote, but they can read finished works even without an account.

1. My website will have the following features:

   1. Users can login with a username and password to access all of the websites features.
   1. Users can write a continuation for the current story segment being worked on during the writing phase.
   1. Users can vote for the story segment they like during the voting phase.
   1. Users can read the story segments that are completed as well as the the 2nd and 3rd highest in votes.
   1. Guests can read the story segments that are completed.
